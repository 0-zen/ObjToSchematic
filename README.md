# ObjToSchematic
A visual tool to convert .obj model files into Minecraft Schematics or [Litematica](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/litematica/files).

# Usage
You can either download the [latest release](https://github.com/LucasDower/ObjToSchematic/releases) or build it yourself by following the instructions below.

* Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
* Run `git clone https://github.com/LucasDower/ObjToSchematic.git` in your command line.
* Navigate to `/ObjToSchematic-main`.
* Run `npm install`.
* Run `npm start`.
* Note, for now, all .obj models **must** be triangulated before importing.

Support for choosing the block palette is not yet supported. Instead, you can edit `/tools/default-ignore-list.txt` to include blocks you don't want to be used and then run `npm run-script atlas`. You can also place custom textures in `/tools/blocks/` for more accurate block-colour matching when building with resource packs.

# Debugging
To allow for your favourite debugging tools like breakpoints and call stacks, I've included launch options for debugging in VSCode. Use `Ctrl+Shift+D`, and run "*Debug Main Process*" and once the Electron window has initialised, run "*Attach to Render Process*".
